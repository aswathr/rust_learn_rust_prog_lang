### Functions

a simple function signature `fn hello_world()`<br>
the `main` function is the entry point for many programs<br>
by convention, snake_case is used in naming functions<br>
Rust doesn't care about order in which functions are defined<br>

statements: instructions that perform some actions and doesn't return a value (for eg. `let x = 5` or `x = x + 2`)<br>
expressions: evaluates to a resultant value (for eg. `{ let x = 9; x * 5 }` or `String::new()`)<br>

function bodies contain a series of statements and may end with a expression<br>
