### Functions

* a simple function signature `fn hello_world()`
* the `main` function is the entry point for many programs
* by convention, snake_case is used in naming functions
* Rust doesn't care about order in which functions are defined

* statements: instructions that perform some actions and doesn't return a value (for eg. `let x = 5` or `x = x + 2`)
* expressions: evaluates to a resultant value (for eg. `{ let x = 9; x * 5 }` or `String::new()`)

* function bodies contain a series of statements and may end with a expression
